# React Compiler

## With React Compiler

Use this command to check compatibility with React Compiler:

```
npx react-compiler-healthcheck@experimental
```

````
npm install eslint-plugin-react-compiler@experimental```
````

```
npm install babel-plugin-react-compiler@experimental
```

React Devtools (v5.0+) has built-in support for React Compiler and will display a “Memo ✨” badge next to components that have been optimized by the compiler.

Memoization uses up memory space on the machine it’s being run on and, as such, may lead to unintended effects.
